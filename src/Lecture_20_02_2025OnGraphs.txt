Graphs:

    Types of graphs:
        1.) Weighted graph (every edge is associated with a weight)
        2.) Unweighted graph (there is no weight associated with an edge)
        3.) Directed graph (has direction)
        4.) Undirected graph (does not have any direction)

    A --- B 
    | \
    C  D --- F -> nodes or vertices
    | -> edges
    E

    Traversals:
        1.) BFS -> using Queue -> TC: O(V+E)
        2.) DFS -> using Stack -> TC: O(V+E) SC:O(V)
