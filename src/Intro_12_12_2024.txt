Data structures:

two types 1. Linear 
          2. Non Linear

Linear: Linked list, stack and queue
Non Linear: Tree, Graph

Linked List:

Node:
    it contains data and address

Linked list types: 
            1. Single ll : single direction is possible
            2. Double ll : forward and backward directions are possible
            3. Circular  : 
                            3a. Singly Circular : forms a loop from last node to first node
                            3b. Doubly Circular : forms a loop from last node to first node using a double ll.

Stack:
    follows FILO (first in last out)

Queue:
    follows FIFO (first in first out)
