Non Linear Datastructures:
    Tree:
        Root is in the begining of the datastructure.
        The base root is the parent root which is the starting point of the tree.
        The connecting lines between two treenodes is called as edge (they can be both incoming and outgoing edges)
        Nodes without any children are called leaf nodes/External nodes except these nodes all other nodes are called Internal nodes.
        Height:- height of the leaf node is 0.
        Level(Depth):- root is at level 0.

        Traversals: (possible on a binary tree)
            . Inorder
            . Post order
            . Pre order
            . Level order
        

             1
           2   5
         8   7    16
            15

        Preorder: root left right: 1 3 8 7 15 5 16
        Inorder: left root right: 8 3 15 7 1 5 16
        Postorder: left right root: 8 15 7 3 16 5 1
        Level order: level by level: 1 2 5 8 7 16 15


        Example
                1
            2       4
          5    8   7   16
        15  4 3  2  6

        Preorder: 1 2 5 15 4 8 3 2 4 7 6 16
        Inorder: 15 5 4 2 3 8 2 1 7 6 4 16
        Postorder: 15 4 5 3 2 8 2 6 7 16 4 1
        Levelorder: 1 2 4 5 8 7 16 15 4 3 2 6


        Types of Trees:
            1. Binary Tree.
            2. Binary Search Tree (BST)
            3. AVL Tree(Balanced Binary Tree)
            4. N-Array Tree  (Each node can have atmost n children)
            5. Red Black Tree (children can't be same color as of the parent)
